# Avoid_obstacles_car

This project implements an autonomous navigation pipeline for a Raspberry Pi–based robot car.
The car moves in maze, recognizes digits, and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor with a 0–180° servo scan.

✔️ Main Features

Blue squires tracking using HSV color segmentation

Digit recognition (YOLO/TensorFlow) to decide left/right turn when a sign is detected

Ultrasonic distance measurement for obstacle detection

Full semicircle servo scan (0–180°) to choose the safest direction

Sector-based decision: LEFT / CENTER / RIGHT

Motor control for forward motion and turning.
